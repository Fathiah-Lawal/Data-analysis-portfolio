Create a Calendar table
Calendar Table=Calendar(min(car_data([Date]),max(car_data([Date]))
Create the year column
Year=Year(Calendar Table[Date])
Also create the month column
Month=Format(Calendar Table[date]),"mmmm")
Create a week column
Week=Weeknum(Calendar Table[Date])

Under the Data model view,create a relationship between the calendar table and the car_data table.
Drag the date under the calendar table to the car_data to create a relationship between the tables.
Upload the background image given to you in your project i.e the car sales background 1.
Measures 
Create a measure by right-clicking on the car_sales data to create YTD Total sales

YTD Total Sales=Totalytd(sum(car_data[Price]),calendar table[date])
Create another measure by right-clicking on the car sales data
PYTD Total sales=calculate(sum(car_data[Price]),sameperiodlastyear(calendar table[Date]))
Create another measure to calculate the sales difference between
 Sales diff=[YTD total sales]-[PYTD total sales]

YOY Sales Growth=[Sales diff]/[PYTD total sales]
Ensure this is formatted to a percentage.

MTD Total Sales=totalmtd(sum(car_data[Price]),calendar table[date])

YTD Avg Price=Totalytd([Avg Price],Calendar Table[Date])
PYTD Avg Price=calculate([Avg Price],sameperiodlastyear(calendar table[date]))
Avg Price diff=[YTD Avg Price]-[PYTD Avg Price]

YOY Avg Price Growth=[Avg Price diff]/[PYTD Avg Price]
MTD Avg Price=Totalmtd([Avg Price],calendar table[date])

YTD Car sold=totalytd(count(car_data[car_id]),calendar table[date])
PYTD Car Sold=calculate(count(car_data[car_id]),sameperiodlastyear(calendar table[date])
Car Sold diff=[ytd car sold]-[pytd car sold]

Create card visuals for these measures

Then follow the instructions in creating the visuals  needed for this project...

Thank you.
